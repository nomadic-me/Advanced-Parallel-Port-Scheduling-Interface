Parallel Port Monitor is a utility for windows 95/98/NT
that permits the three registers of the parallel port to 
be spied upon.

FAQ

Q: How do I change which parallel port is being spied
   upon?
A: Click on any cell in the port column.  If there is 
   more than one port, the next one will be selected.

Q:  How do I edit the values ports values?
A:  Simply click on the cell that you wish to edit and
    type the new value.  Press <ENTER> when you are done,
    or <ESC> to cancel the edit.  Some registers cannot
    be edited and therefore will not change.

Q:  What's the "Beep" column all about?
A:  You can toggle each beep cell between "Yes" and "No".
    When the cell is yes, a beep will sound when the
    corresponding register changes.  If for some reason
    you want to toggle all cells, just click on the
    column title.

Q:  Is there a way to toggle individual bits?
A:  All of the output bits may be toggled by clicking on
    the appropriate pin on the connector diagram. 
    Obviously, input pins cannot be toggled.

Q:  What's the deal with the female/male connector box?
A:  Suppose you have a cable in front of you.  By 
    selecting female/male, you can easily match up the
    pins to those in the connector diagram.

Q:  On the connector, some pins are green while others
    are red.  What's the difference?
A:  Green pins are low, red pins are high.  This can
    be changed to whatever you want, however.

Q:  What does "Always on top" do.
A:  Since this program *is* a monitor program, chances
    are you want to see what it's doing.  By checking 
    this box, the program will always be visible.

Q:  Why would I want to disable the connector?
A:  If your system is particularly slow, you may find
    that it flickers when it is updated, which can be
    annoying.

Q:  What does sample rate do?
A:  Sample rate determines how often the state of the
    port is sampled?  It defaults to "as fast as 
    possible".  You may find, however, that this will
    slow your machine down too much.

Q:  What about the blink on sample box?
A:  When this box is checked, a small indicator will
    appear to the lower left of the connector.  Every
    time a sample is taken, it will blink to a different
    color.  This is useful if your sample rate is fairly
    long.  With a short sample rate, checking this box
    can have detrimental effects.

And the most frequently asked question:

Q:  Can you change Parallel Port Monitor so it logs the
    data?
A:  Yes I could, but I'm not going to.  The reason for 
    this is that the program works by taking periodic
    samples of the state of the parallel port.  
    Therefore all state changes between samples are 
    not even noticed.  While this is ok for viewing
    with the eye, it is rather lousy for logging because
    a lot of information will be missing from the log
    potentially causing confusion.
